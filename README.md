# Conrod Hello world

A quick hello world example using the Conrod Rust UI library. It is taken from
the official repository of the Conrod library. I made this repository because
all the examples I could find were using the outdated unified crate, and this
example isn't mentioned in any of the docs.

Just run
```
cargo run
```
